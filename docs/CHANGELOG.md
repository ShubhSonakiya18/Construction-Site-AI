# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to Construction Site AI are documented here.
Format: `[Sprint X] Date — Description`

---

## [Sprint 1.1] 2026-06-30 — Sprint 1 Freeze & Knowledge Base Extension

### Added
- `knowledge/construction_rules.json` — 38 machine-readable construction rules (sequential, parallel, material consistency, worker consistency, safety constraints, weather constraints, quantity sanity)
- `knowledge/dependency_graph.json` — Complete DAG of residential construction workflow with 23 nodes, 33 edges, critical path, parallel groups, and topological sort
- `knowledge/validation_rules.json` — 35 machine-readable validation rules with conditions, severities, error messages, and suggested fixes (consumed by Sprint 2 generators and Sprint 4 AI validator)
- `knowledge/construction_ontology.json` — Complete entity-relationship ontology covering trades, materials, equipment, hazards, PPE, worker roles, inspection types, delay types, and weather conditions with 40+ relationships. Designed for future RAG/FAISS integration
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This file (project change history)
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — Architecture decision record
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` — Official project state (moved from root to docs/)
- `docs/NEXT_SPRINT.md` — Sprint 2 preparation document
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Full product roadmap
- `docs/HANDOVER.md` — Complete handover document for new sessions

### Fixed (Sprint 1 Gaps Identified)
- Gap: `construction_stages.json` covered only 11 stages but `current_stage` schema enum had 22 values. The ontology and dependency graph now cover all 22 stages.
- Gap: Sequencing rules were embedded inside `construction_stages.json` as a sub-object. Extracted to dedicated `construction_rules.json`.
- Gap: No machine-readable validation for dataset generators. Resolved with `validation_rules.json`.
- Gap: No entity-relationship model for future AI/RAG use. Resolved with `construction_ontology.json`.

## [Sprint 1.0] 2026-06-30 — Sprint 1 Initial Delivery

### Added
- `knowledge/construction_stages.json` — Knowledge base for all 11 residential construction stages with workers, materials, tools, delays, safety hazards, and daily report fields
- `knowledge/construction_daily_log_schema.json` — Master ConstructionDailyLog JSON Schema v1.0.0 with 12 sections, 80+ fields, UUID keys, explicit null typing, enum validation, and complete example
- `docs/sprint_1/CONSTRUCTION_RESEARCH.md` — Human-readable domain research on all 11 stages
- `docs/sprint_1/SCHEMA_DESIGN.md` — Architecture decisions explaining schema design choices
- `README.md` — Project overview with tech stack and sprint progress
- `.gitignore` — Python, Node, Docker, and AI model ignore rules
- `.env.example` — Complete environment variable template for all future modules
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` (root) — Sprint 1 state document (frozen as Sprint 1 artifact)

---

## [Unreleased — Sprint 2] Pending Approval

### Planned
- `datasets/` folder structure
- `scripts/generators/` Python scripts for 5 datasets
- 5,000 synthetic daily site logs (JSONL)
- Safety toolbox talks dataset (CSV, based on OSHA)
- Material database (~500 materials, CSV)
- Customer progress examples (1,000 pairs, JSONL)
- Project schedules (1,000 schedules, JSONL)
- Dataset versioning and README
